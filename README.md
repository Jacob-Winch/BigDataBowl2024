# Tackles Above Average: Determining Tackle Probability at the Moment of a Catch
Are the current measurements of total tackles and number of missed tackles a great representation and indication of individual tackling skill? Although these statistics are informative, they do not provide the context around the tackle as they equally weigh each tackle. For example, a tackle could be hard to make as the player could be far away from the play, but the tackler swoops in to secure the ball carrier against high odds. Rather than measuring individuals by total tackles, we aim to quantify each tackle's difficulty to understand better a defender's true skill level and contribution to the game, ensuring that each play is evaluated in the context of its unique circumstances and challenges. 

We aim to predict a defender’s probability of tackling a ball carrier based on their position and distance away from the ball while factoring in speed and acceleration. The inspiration for this project comes from Baseball Savant’s outs above-average (OAA) metric. This metric focuses on an outfielder's ability to convert fly balls into outs relative to his peers. Similarly, we want to focus on a defensive player's ability to make tackles that an average NFL defender would not be expected to make. We accomplish this given a set of criteria describing a play, such as distance and speed. Expected tackle models can be useful tools for professionals and coaches to help identify individual players who thrive on tackling more than expected or vice versa, pinpoint players who miss tackles they should make. Ultimately, we want to contextualize and quantify the tackling statistics to be more informative and useful than current counting measurements.
